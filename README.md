Module 13 Homework assignment

# The Solution

The solution is focussed on comparing the accuraracy scores of two popular classification Models - 1) Logistics Regrion 2) Random Forest

Please refer to the solution file "spam_detector.ipynb"

The data is located at https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv

Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Library

The steps required to prepare the data and feed into the models are similar and shared between the two models. 

Following steps were executed:

1) Reading the dataset

2) Analyzing the dataset for various features and target

3) Splitting the dataset into train and test

4) Scaling the features 

5) Running the two models by first training and then predicting using test

    a) Logistics Regression

    b) Random Forest

6) Deriving the accuracy scores for each model

7) Evaluating the results

# The conclusion

As expectedly, the random forest classifier prediction marginally outperformed the logistics regression classifier models.
